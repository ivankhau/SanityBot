# SanityBot
Bot I wrote using Bash. Bot checks and installs new software bundles onto a device. The bot then runs a test suite to test if changes in the new software bundle causes any hangs or panics in various test envorinments. After testing is complete, a message will be sent to Mattermost with the results.
